STL(Standard Template library)

Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of C++ template classes providing containers to store data (vectors, lists, maps) as well as algorithms to perform around them (searching, sorting).

Major advantages of using STL are reusability, efficiency, readability, and consistency in coding practices.

STL has 3 parts-
1. Containers [EX- Vector , String, Map]
2. Algorithms - reusable functions. [ex- in vector sort(),reverse(),push_back()]
3. Iterators. -Iterators are objects that allow you to traverse through elements in various containers, such as arrays, vectors, sets, and maps (we'll look at sets and maps soon). They provide a way to access and manipulate elements within these containers.
